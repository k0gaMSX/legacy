==============================================================================
0005	BDOS entry

005C	Allocate a 16k segment (memmory management)
	Input: [ A] - 0 = user segment
		      1 = system segment
	       [ B] - 0 = primary mapper
		    - FxxxSSPP = slot adress (primary mapper, if 0)
		       xxx=000 = allocate specified slot only

			 failed, try another slot (if any)
