What is SIL?
============

SIL is a compiler for an extended subset of the C programming 
language, suitable for use in systems programming. It is a subset of C 
in that only certain minimal features and data types are supported; it 
is extended in that certain features have been added to make it more 
useful in a Z80 systems programming environment. Code produced by SIL 
is quite system independent; it can run as easily (or as difficultly) 
on AOS as CP/M, or with no host operating system at all. It is 
recursive; sadly, version 1.4 is no longer romable directly, although 
it could be made so for that "special" application.

I will make no attempt to describe C here. Refer to the book by 
Kernighan and Ritchie called "The C Programming Language" for an 
introduction to what C is all about.

SIL users, take note; version 1.4 and later versions use a different 
parameter passing scheme from previous versions; therefore, any 
routines coded in assembler must do one of the following:

   - exit thru an implied SIL return instruction, which will remove 
any passed parameters from the stack; or,

   - pop all passed parameters from the stack before returning to the 
caller.

Failure to observe the above will result in your program attempting to 
execute code in that elusive 65th k of memory we call the twilight 
zone.

SIL 1.5 supports a few enhancements which you may find useful. They 
are explained in detail below; in brief they are:

   -a case statement called SWITCH

   -conditional compilation using toggles

   -automatic externalization of undefined functions (enabled by an 
optional parameter)

   -some minor tightening up of error conditions

   -readable string constants in the output file

   -2 new library functions, PEEKW and POKEW

   -TurboDOS option parameter to abort a DO file on errors

Files You May Need
==================

There are several files needed to make up a SIL development 
environment, besides the normal system utilities (ED, PIP, etc.).  
These are as follows:

	SIL.COM		- the compiler
	SOP.COM		- the output optimizer
	RMAC.COM	- the assembler
	LINK.COM	- the linker
	LIB.COM		- the librarian
	SILLIB.REL	- a mandatory external SIL intrinsics library
	SILZ80.LIB	- macro library needed for assembler
	CPMDIO.REL	- CP/M interface routines library

See the appropriate utility manuals; the CP/M system manuals might 
also be of some help.

(Note: If you don't have RMAC/LINK, you may use other similar tools. I 
used SLR and SLRNK. M80/L80 will work. In the list above, SIL.COM and 
SILLIB.REL are required. SOP.COM, the librarian LIB.COM, SILZ80.LIB 
and CPMDIO.REL are optional. (lrb))

SIL Operation
=============

The SIL compiler is invoked by the CP/M statement:

	SIL <filename>

where <filename> may or may not have a drive prefix. No file type 
extension should be given; the compiler looks for <filename>.SIL as 
the source file. Output of the compiler is a file called 
<filename>.ASM, suitable for input to the RMAC macro assembler. SIL 
source lines are included as comments in the output file (unless the 
'n' parameter is given), along with any error messages.

Caution: Inclusion of the file type (.SIL) will cause the .SIL source 
file to be over-written with the generated .ASM file.

The <parameter list> is any of the following compiler options.  
Multiple parameters are separated by spaces.

Additional parameters are:

  A - designates compiler output file.
  B - causes SIL output to be 8080-compatible code.
  C - causes SIL to verify function calls with parameters.
  E - externalizes any undefined procedures.
  N - inhibits inclusion of SIL source lines as comments.
  P - sets the literal/define pool space.
  Q - causes string literals to be created in readable form.
  S - causes the global/define table to be written to disk.
  T - causes the compiler to abort a 'DO' file process on errors.

The "A" or "a" parameter is used to designate the filename of the 
compiler output file if the default output destination file 
<filename>.ASM is not desired. The parameter is used as follows:

	SIL <filename> A<output filename>

The output file is still assigned as type .ASM.

Option "B" forces SIL (and the corresponding version of SOP) to emit 
8080 compatible code.

Option "C" allows the user some debug capability; when this option is 
specified, SIL emits code that verifies that the correct number of 
parameters are passed on every function call. If an incorrect number 
of parameters is passed, an error message is printed along with the 
address of the called routine, and the address of the offending call 
instruction. Note that a special hack is required to use this option; 
before the first procedure of the program is executed, the A-register 
must contain the number of parameters to that procedure (usually 0 if 
the first procedure is main).

Option "E" automatically makes any undefined procedures external, thus 
obviating the need for a long list of external library procedure 
declarations at the start of each program. If the optional is not 
given, any undefined procedures not declared external will generate an 
error.

The "N" or "n" parameter may be given to the compiler to inhibit the 
inclusion of SIL source text in the output assembler file. The 
parameter is used as follows:

  SIL <filename> N

To change the size of the literal/define pool use the "p" or "P" 
option. For example, if a pool size of 1k is desired:

	SIL <filename> P400

Increasing the pool size may be necessary when compiling files with a 
large number of literals and/or strings.

Option "Q" will force string literals to be dumped at the end of the 
program in readable form; ie., DB 'THIS IS A STRING',0. This is given 
as an option only because the old form of DB 20H,53H, etc., must still 
be used for programs which use the single quote character "'" in 
strings.

To write the global/define table to disk, use the parameter "s" or 
"S". The name of the file written is <filename>.SYM.

The "T" parameter causes the compiler to abort a TurboDOS 'DO' file 
process (if one has been invoked) when errors are detected. This 
prevents any further processing (such as RMAC and LINK) from 
occurring, which would serve no useful purpose until the errors are 
corrected.

These parameters may be given in any order. Example:

  SIL <filename> Q S N P1000 T ATEST

The next step is to assemble the ASM file with RMAC, and to link the 
assembled file into an executable binary file with LINK. If the file 
is destined for execution in a non-CP/M environment, a utility such as 
CPMAOS is then used to place it in the appropriate environment.

A sample sequence of commands follows.

	SIL B:XYZ		; compiles a file called XYZ.SIL
				; on drive B: into a file called
				; XYZ.ASM on drive B:.
				; During the compilation,
				; names of functions are echoed
				; to the screen as they are
				; encountered, along with any
                                ; compile error messages.
	A Clean Compile!	; Message from the compiler
				; indicating no errors were found.
	SOP B:XYZ		; An optional command which will
				; improve some of the code emitted
				; by the compiler
                                ; probably not worth it for small files.
        RMAC B:XYZ $AB RB SZ PZ ; Assembly of the file into B:XYZ.REL.
	LINK B:XYZ,SILLIB[S]	; Links the compiled file to
				; needed intrinsics.

The result of the above is a file ORG'd at 100H, presumably suitable 
for execution under CP/M. Use the "L" linker option to generate 
modules ORG'd at other addresses.

When assembling the output file, RMAC will require the MACRO library 
file SILZ80.LIB for programs that are to be executed in a Z80 
environment.

Note that this example could be extended to include other application 
libraries or compiled REL files, and other linker options.

Note also that, due to some simple-mindedness on the part of LINK, you 
may have to give the SILEXT library name twice, as follows:

	LINK B:PORKER,SILLIB[S],SILLIB[S]

To use SOP, commands may take one of two variations. If one file is 
given, then the extension ".ASM" is understood, and the resulting file 
is located on the same drive as the original file. For example:

	SOP B:WHATAPIG

If two filenames are given (to direct the sopped file to another 
drive), then the full names of each file must be given. For example:

	SOP B:BLAT1500.ASM C:BLAT1500.ASM

SOP will abort processing upon receipt of control 'C'.

SIL Limitations
===============

The following restrictions apply to SIL, as distinct from full C.

- Variable names are significant only in the first 8 characters (first 
6 for external or public names). They must start with a letter and 
consist of letters or digits only (no underscores). Upper and lower 
case are not distinct.

- Only char and int data types are supported (int is 16-bit unsigned, 
a la the PL/M ADDRESS type). Structures, unions, floats, longs, etc. 
are not supported (maybe someday).

- Only 1 level of indirection is supported, ie., a declaration such as

	char ****pc;

which establishes a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to a pointer to 
a character, is invalid. In my experience, 99 and 44/100ths of all 
pointer uses are only 1 level deep; multiple levels are easily 
achieved thru the appropriate explicit code.

- The C type switch/case statements are not supported. However, a 
similar capability exists with the SWITCH statement (see below).

- The only valid preprocessor directives are as follows:

	#define
	#include (1 level only)
	#asm
	#endasm
	#toggle
	#ifon
	#ifoff
	#endif

- Binary operators supported are as follows:

	+, -, *, /, %(mod), ^(xor), |(or), &(and),
	>, <, ==, !=, <=, >=, <<(shift left), >>(shift right),
	=(assignment).

Since = is a true operator, expressions like

	a=b=c=0;
or
	xry[alpha=(beta-gamma)] = xfunc(a,(b=c-d));

are quite valid.

- Unary operators supported are:

	++, --, *, ~, !, -, &.

- Labels (for use with the GO statement) must be declared, and are 
local within a procedure (no global labels allowed). They must occur 
with a leading colon. Example:

	func()
	{	label xx,yy,zz;
		.
		.
		go yy;
	:xx
		.
		.
	:yy
	}

- Only 1-dimensional arrays are supported.

- No I/O statements exist. (Use library functions)

- The syntax of the FOR statement in SIL has been modified very 
slightly to make it a bit easier to compile. In standard C, a typical 
FOR statement might look as follows:

	for (i=0; i<100; i++)

In SIL, a semi-colon after the last phrase is needed, as follows:

	for (i=0; i<100; i++;)

SIL Enhancements
================

The following features describe enhancements to SIL apart from 
standard C:

- The #toggle directive establishes a compile-time toggle and assigns 
that toggle a value, ie.

	#toggle <toggle name> on/off

Examples:

	#toggle alpha on
	#toggle beta off

An existing toggle may be set on and off as many times as desired, but 
the #toggle directive may not be placed within a function.

- The #ifon and #ifoff directives use the toggles established with 
#toggle for purposes of conditional compilation. Conditional 
toggles may be nested as deeply as desired, although there must be an 
#endif for every #if. #if<on/off> may be outside or inside a function.

Example:

	#toggle benice on
	.
	.
	#ifon benice
	wrlstr("HAVE A NICE DAY!");
	#endif

	#ifoff benice
	wrlstr("HAVE A ROTTEN DAY!");
	#endif

- The #asm, #endasm directives allow in-line assembler code anywhere 
in a program.

- A command for multi-way decisions called SWITCH exists. The general 
format of SWITCH is as follows:

	switch <expression> {

	case <expression>:
		.
	case <expression>:
		.
			 }

	else {
		.
	  }

The first expression is evaluated and stored, and then each case is 
checked for a match. If a match is found, then the code between that 
case and the next case is executed. Cases may be in any order; note 
that they do not run into each other, as in the C switch statement. 
The else clause is optional and is executed if none of the cases match.

Example:

 switch coninp()-'0' {

	case 0:	reboot();
	case 1: proc1();
		x=x+3;

	case 2-z: proc2();
			}
 else {
	wrlstr("Not in explicit cases!");
	z=z-x(19);}

Note that the continue and break statements are usable here; continue 
takes control back to the first code after the computation of the 
switch value, while break takes control out of case evaluation 
altogether.

- In addition to while, do/while, and for statements, a do/until 
statement of obvious function is implemented. A varient of do 
available is do/forever, which loops infinitely until a break or 
return statement is executed.

- Hex constants are available; they are denoted by a preceding @-sign, 
eg., @C3.

- Global (not within a function) variables may be declared public 
or external. (Default condition is referred to as local). If they are 
not external, then they may be declared as preset to some starting 
value. This variant on the declaration syntax is as follows:

	<char/int> <public/external> <preset> <variable list>;

 eg:
	char public x;
	int external cout, sum, tie5;
	char preset c1, c2, ary[100];
	int public preset bigint[5];

If the variable(s) is(are) preset, then it is up to the programmer to 
accurately define (at the assembler level) the existence of the 
variables concerned (the compiler will emit code to make the variables 
public). If the variable is local and not preset, the compiler will 
set it up automatically.

-Functions may be declared public by following the function name by 
the word "public" in the function declaration, eg.,

	myfunc public (a1, a2)
	char a1, a2;
	{. . .}

- Functions may be declared external by setting up a dummy declaration 
with no parameters or body, as follows:

	search external();

Obviously, the function must be really declared in some other module, 
to be found at link time.

- Non-external functions may also be declared non-recursive. This 
will cause local variables to be stored in a heap area (not on the 
stack), reducing the code needed to access them to the same amount 
needed for global variables. This does, however, sacrifice the 
recursive/reentrant nature of that particular function.

 Example:

	myfunc public static(a)
	char a;

	mynewfunc static()

Local variables for static functions are stored in an area known as 
CCHEAP. Normally, CCHEAP is located at the end of the compiled 
program; if this has to be changed (if, for example, the program will 
be run from PROM), CCHEAP may be declared as if it were any normal 
variable, and the compiler will suppress automatic generation of the 
heap. Note that a comment at the end of the compiled program output 
tells how large the heap must be.

 Example:

	char external ccheap[1];

would enable a prom-based program to reference a heap defined 
elsewhere at link time.

SIL FUNCTIONS
=============

- Several useful functions are provided with SILLIB, as listed below. 
These must be declared as external if they are to be used (see above), 
and are called as though they were local functions declared as follows:

--Alpha returns true if c is an upper or lower case alphabetic.

	alpha(c)
	char c;

--An returns the alphanumeric status of the input character 
(1=alphanumeric, 0=not alphanumeric).

  an(c)
  char c;

--Aparse returns the number of parameters in the command line and puts 
a pointer to each parameter in the array (command line starts at @80).

  aparse(array)
  int *array;

--Cmndfcb returns the default fcb made up by CP/M when a program is 
loaded. This fcb then can be used for file operations as though it 
had been made up by the cmndline and setfcb functions.

  cmndfcb(fcb)
  char *fcb;

--Cmndline returns a pointer to the input string in the CP/M command 
line (in normal SIL format).

  cmndline(s)
  char *s;

--Digit returns a true value if c is a numeric character.

	digit(c)
	char c;

--Fill fills a block of memory len bytes long from address start with 
char c. It returns the next address to fill.

	fill(c,start,len)
 	char c,*start;
	int len;

--Highb returns the upper 8 bits of a 16-bit value as a character.

  highb(value)
  int value;

--Inp returns the result of an input instruction from the desired port.

  inp(port)
  int port;

--Lowb returns the lower 8 bits of a 16-bit value as a character.

  lowb(value)
  int value;

--Move moves a block of memory len bytes long up from address source 
to address dest. It returns the next address to be moved into. This 
function uses the Z80 LDIR instruction.

	move(source,dest,len)
	char *source,*dest;
	int len;

--Movedn moves a block of memory len bytes long down from address 
source to address dest. It returns the next address to be moved into. 
This function uses the Z80 LDDR instruction.

	movedn(source,dest,len)
	char *source,*dest;
	int len;

--Outp outputs the given character to the given port.

  outp(port,c)
  int port;
  char c;

--Peek returns the value of the byte at the given address. This is 
handy to use when constructing a pointer to a byte for temporary 
purposes would be clumsy.

  peek(adrs)
  char *adrs;

--Peekw returns the 16-bit value whose LSB is at <adrs>, MSB at 
<adrs>+1.

	peekw(adrs)
	int *adrs;

--Poke places the input character at the input address, and returns 
the old contents of the input address. It can be used in the same sort 
of situation as peek above.

  poke(adrs,c)
  char *adrs,c;

--Pokew places the 16-bit value LSB at <adrs>, MSB at <adrs>+1.

	pokew(adrs,val);
	int *adrs,val;

--Search returns a pointer to the next character after c from address 
start. If c is not found before length len is exhausted, a 0 is 
returned.

	search(c,start,len)
	char c,*start;
	int len;

--Setfcb sets the given file name into the given fcb and clears out 
the other fcb areas. The file name may have a drive designation and 
type extension as in normal command usage.

  setfcb(file,fcb)
  char *file,*fcb;

--Strcat concatenates the source string behind the destination string.

	strcat(dest,source)
	char *dest,*source;

--Strcmp returns a true value if string s1 is the same as string s2.

	strcmp(s1,s2)
	char *s1,*s2;

--Strcpy copies the source string to the destination string.

	strcpy(dest,source)
	char *dest,*source;

--Strlen returns the length of a string.

	strlen(string)
	char *string;

--Struc forces all lower-case letters in a string to upper case.

	struc(string)
	char *string;

--Uc returns the upper case value of c. 

	uc(c)
	char c;

CP/M INTERFACE ROUTINES
=======================

- The library CPMDIO contains CP/M interface routines for those 
programs destined to run under CP/M. Again, these routines must be 
declared external at compile time, and the library must be linked (in 
fact, it must be the last item linked) at link time. The CP/M

Notes for SIL Users
===================

- In many ways, SIL is quite simple-minded. Thus, functions could be 
declared in any order; "main" need not be first. However, execution 
starts at the top of the program (ie., the first code in the first 
function) and works its way down. Note that SIL does not mind at all 
if you reference a function that does not exist, although he does care 
about such variable references.

- It is very important for the stack to have a valid value at the 
start of the program. Therefore, if it is not set up automatically at 
run time, the stack pointer should be given a valid value (in 
assembler) before the first function.

 Example:

  char stack[200];
  #asm
    LXI SP,stack+200
  #endasm

- Global variables can be accessed directly by name in assembler; 
defines cannot. Recursive local variables are a bit of a pain to 
access in assembler, although just naming the variable in SIL will 
load it into the HL registers, eg.,

	xyz(a)
	char a;
	{
	 a;	/* move a to register L */
#asm
		MOV	A,L
		OUT	CPORT
#endasm
	}

- RMAC will be very confused if you give any global variables any of 
the following names:

	A, B, C, D, E, H, L, PSW, SP

so don't do it.

Local variables are maintained on the stack or on the heap, so it's ok 
to use such names there.

- Function values are returned in the HL register pair; thus, an 
assembler routine can easily return a value, eg.,

	inport()
	{
  #asm
	 IN	CONTROLPORT
	 MOV	L,A
	 MVI	H,0		; clear upper bits
  #endasm
	}

- Routines located at absolute locations can be called directly, with 
or without parameters, eg.,

	#define EDITOR @23F0
	.
	.
	EDITOR();

- Function names/routine addresses can be passed as parameters, placed 
into variables, or whatever, in order to access the functions more 
easily. One way to take advantage of this feature is to make a preset 
switch array and index into it with a status to find the routine to 
call, eg.,

	int preset swtch[5];
	.
	.
	swtch[getstatus()](param1, param2); /* function call */
	.
	.
#asm
swtch:	DW	FUNC1	; can be assembler, SIL, or 
      ; absolute address routines
	DW	FUNC2
	DW	FUNC3
	etc.
#endasm

- Parameters passed to functions are on the stack; therefore, if you 
need to directly access parameters in assembly language, the easiest 
thing to do is 1)pop the return address, 2)pop the parameters, 3)push 
back the parameters if you are going to return thru SIL (ie., don't 
include a RET instruction, the closing bracket of the function will 
cause SIL to perform the return), and 4)do something meaningful with 
the data you just got. The parameters need not be pushed back onto 
the stack (item 3 above) if the RET instruction is explicitly 
included. System Note: If the return is performed thru SIL, a 
special library function (CCAHAK) is called which clears the 
parameters from the stack and returns to the calling routine.

- Labels starting with CC are reserved for compiler use.

- Remember that the SIL and assembler levels are distinct; you, 
therefore, may have to establish certain values both as equates, for 
assembler routines, and as defines for SIL.

- The best way to figure out what SIL is doing is to play with it.

Optimization Tricks, Hacks, and assorted Fol-de-rol
===================================================

- Use x=y=expression; instead of x=expression; y=expression;

- Use global or static local data instead of recursive local data 
whenever possible.

- Use a defined hex value instead of a negated constant whenever 
possible, eg.,

	#define MINUS1 @FFFF
	.
	.
	a = MINUS1;

instead of

	a = -1;

- DO-WHILE and DO-UNTIL are somewhat more efficient than WHILE. DO- 
FOREVER is best of all, if applicable.

- A test for a variable being true can be the variable itself, eg.,

	if (a)

is the same as (and better than)

	if (a>0)  or  if (a!=0)

Since all constant strings are terminated by 0, this makes a handy end- 
of-string test. For example, consider the following function which 
copies the string at address s1 to the string at address s2.

	strcpy(s1,s2)
	char *s1,*s2;
	{
	 do; /* a null statement */
	 while(*s2++ = *s1++);
	}

- Variable assignments within expressions are always more efficient, 
eg.,

	char *pc;
	*(pc=getptr()) = 'Z';

is better (if less obvious) than

	char *pc;
	pc = getptr();
	*pc = 'Z';
