PURPOSE
=======

The purpose of this document is to provide an overview of what the SIL 
compiler is and to maintain a list of known bugs or problems as they 
are determined. Any other hints or suggestions will be voiced in this 
document as well. I will attempt to update this information 
periodically in order to keep it current. Bug reports, suggestions or 
whatever can be sent to me directly. The address is:

Note: No replies will be made unless a self-addressed-stamped-envelope 
is provided.

DOCUMENTATION
=============

All  documents associated with SIL have been created with WordStar. 
Therefore, you can print these documents with the Print facility in 
WordStar or by any other simple means. Note that the special 
characters or DOT commands used by WordStar are imbedded in the DOC 
files.

(Note: I have re-formatted this document. (lrb))

OVERVIEW
========

SIL (Systems Implementation Language) is an extended subset of the 'C' 
programming language. It was developed for implementing many system 
utilities and proprietary operating systems at Digilog, Inc. SIL was 
originally conceived by Andy Erlanger and Mike Buckley who developed 
it from the Caine compiler which appeared in Dr. Dobb's Journal many 
years ago and expanded it into what is now know as SIL version 1.5. 
Since SIL is not copyrighted, it was decided to release it into the 
Public Domain. There seems to be few (if any) good 'C' compilers in 
the Public Domain; SIL just might be useful to those who want to 
tinker with 'C' without investing in a true 'C' compiler. SIL is 
surprisingly efficient in code generation and execution. I have not 
tried any bench mark programs such as the sieve program; I'll leave 
that to some industrious soul. The documentation file provided 
(SIL.DOC) describes the differences from SIL and true 'C' and the 
library functions.

REQUIREMENTS
============

You will require the following files and utilities:

*  SIL.COM     - the SIL compiler
   RMAC.COM    - Digital Research Inc.'s Relocatable Assembler
   LINK.COM    - Digital Research Inc.'s Linker
*  SILLIB.REL  - SIL function library in relocatable format
*  CPMDIO.REL  - SIL linkage library to CP/M functions
*  SILZ80.LIB  - Macro library for assembling Z80 mnemonics

Note: Files marked with an asterisk (*) are provided with the SIL 
distribution package.

THE SIL COMPILER
================

The SIL compiler takes an ASCII source file as input and generates 
true 8080-type Z80 or, optionally, 8080 assembly code as output. Note 
that 8080-type means that the Intel mnemonic representation is 
followed versus the Zilog mnemonics. This is good and bad. Good 
because you can use the standard ASM, MAC or RMAC assemblers. Bad 
because those of us who prefer Z80 mnemonics have to go back to the 
8080 book to understand what's going on. Of course, at the time, there 
really weren't any good true Z80 assemblers for CP/M-80; at least 
until Microsoft's M80. Well, you shouldn't need to use assembly code 
too often anyway.

Originally, it was intended to have our own assembler and linker in 
order to have a complete package, but since Digital Research provides 
a nice relocatable assembler and linker, it was decided to scrap our 
own. Therefore, in order to assemble the output file from the SIL 
compiler, you will need DRI's RMAC and LINK utilities. The ASM and MAC 
assemblers can be used, but accessing the CP/M and SIL libraries is 
not possible. They can be used if the SIL program you are creating is 
to be run standalone or you provide your own interface routines within 
the program.

The LIB utility is quite useful if you wish to make additional 
function libraries or you wish to add to the current ones. Two 
function libraries are included with the SIL  distribution package. 
They are: SILLIB.REL and CPMDIO.REL. SILLIB.REL contains several 
useful functions such as peek and poke a byte or word, input or output 
to a port, move a block of data, fill a block of data, etc. CPMDIO.REL 
contains the linkage routines to the CP/M function calls such as 
console input and output. Incidentally, the SIL compiler is written in 
SIL.

SYSTEM NOTES 
============

Many limitations of SIL are described in the SIL Manual but are 
spelled out again here for the sake of clarity and amplification.

1. Only character (char) and integer (int) data types are supported.

   char -  1 byte (8 bits)
   int -  2 bytes (16 bits unsigned)

2. Variable names are significant only in the first 8 characters.  
External or publicly defined variables (or functions) are significant 
to the first 6 characters. Underscores are not permissable. EX:

   testfunction() is the same as testfunc()

3. When issuing the compiler directive from the system prompt, DO NOT 
include the file extent .SIL as part of the filename. EX:

   DON'T:
     SIL test.sil
   DO:
     SIL test

Failure to follow this rule will cause the SIL compiler to output the 
assembly code to the .SIL file instead of the .ASM file, and, if you 
don't have a backup of your .SIL source file, you lose.

4. The FOR statement in SIL requires a semicolon after the last 
phrase. EX:
   
   DON'T:
     for(i=0; i<10; i++)
   DO:
     for(i=0; i<10; i++;)

5. If you use the 'E' parameter when compiling, all undefined 
procedures will automatically be made external. However, if the 
function is not found during link time, the procedure address will be 
0 and thus cause a call to location 0 when the procedure is executed. 
Take note, in a CP/M environment, this causes a warm boot.

6. Define a stack large enough to handle your program. Usually a stack 
of 50 is large enough to handle a program which DOES NOT use recursive 
procedures and does not use many levels of nested procedures. 
Recursive programs have been known to use stacks as large as 200 and 
up. If strange things occur, first try a larger stack.

BUGS
====

The following list describes the known bugs to date. Those marked 
"Unconfirmed" mean that the problem has been reported but a sample 
program with the bug is not available. Therefore, it may not be 
reproducable in some situations.

1. Problem: Incorrect jump address generated when using the GO 
statement. Unconfirmed.

Date: August 1983

Description: When using the GO statement from within several nested 
while or for loops and jumping to outside the outer loop, the compiler 
will sometimes create a jump to an address immediately following or 
preceeding the correct address. This problem is not well defined in 
that it does not occur in all situations. It has not been determined 
exactly what sequence will cause this problem.

Solution: Don't use the GO statement in nested loops (some would argue 
that a true structured program should never have GO statements, but 
then they never had to generate efficient code either) or try it first 
and if it bombs, rewrite it.

2. Problem: Break statement does not exit a for loop properly.  
Unconfirmed.

Date: August 1983

Description: When using a break statement to break out of a for loop,  
control may not be passed to the statement immediately following the 
for loop definition. Control will remain within the for loop.

Solution: Use a do or while loop or a GO statement with a label.

3. Problem: Preset syntax is not recognized properly when used in a 
string of variable definitions. Unconfirmed.

Date: August 1983

Description: For example, cannot use the form:

     char public 
        test1,
        test2,
        preset test3;

Solution: Provide the variable type when using the preset syntax.  
Using the above example, change to the following form:

     char public
        test1,
        test2;
     char public preset test3;

4. Problem: The 'continue' statement does not conform to the 'C' 
definition in a 'for' loop.

Date: May 1984

Description: When a 'continue' statement is used within a 'for' loop, 
the statement execution continues at the top of the loop but the 'for' 
loop variable is not incremented.

   ex:
     for (i=30; i<36; i++;)
        { 
        if ( (i>39) | (i<41) ) continue;
        conout(i);
        }
   
When 'i' is greater than 39 the 'if' statement will be true and 
exectution will continue at the top of the for loop. The 'i' variable 
will not be incremented and this becomes an infinite loop.

Solution: Either use a 'go' statement with a label at the end of the 
for loop structure, or use a unary increment on the loop variable 
prior to executing the continue statement. The example shown above 
would then become:

  1)   
   label loopend;
     for (i=30; i<36; i++;)
        { 
        if ( (i>39) | (i<41) ) go loopend;
        conout(i);
   :loopend
        }
or

  2)   
     for (i=30; i<36; i++;)
        { 
        if ( (i>39) | (i<41) ) { i++; continue; }
        conout(i);
        }

SUPPORT
=======

I do not support this compiler in any way; you use it at your own 
risk. That is, you're not paying to use the compiler so don't expect 
to get support for the same price. However, I will try to maintain 
bugs, suggestions, etc., via this document. If possible, any known 
bugs will be corrected and enhancements included in later versions of 
the SIL compiler.

DISTRIBUTION
============

Note: This compiler is not to be sold or distributed without prior 
approval. Any contribution for the development of this compiler will 
be greatly appreciated.
