ASCII's MSX Datapack (Vol. 2).

    The following  is a map of MSX I/O ports, standard  defined along  the
time by hardware makers all around the Earth. New  hardware must take care
to  not use already occupied ports (I have seen  people saying "oh, nobody
uses this anymore!"). Based on  my knowledge  on Murphy's  Laws, surely at
least  one user that purchases your product will have  AND USE  the device
with conflicting ports. It will not only have very powerful links with the
consumer's protection organizations but, far worst, with  an  unknow, even
to M.I.B., and  particularly  sadistic branch  of Cthulhu's followers). Be
careful...

                transfer rate to keep compatibility, newer and faster data
                storage devices won't be able to  work properly using this
                access. Standard FDC use memory registers, which  can also
                be  accessed  faster than  by I/O ports. The  use of these
                ports also brings some access conflict problems. Only some
                brazilian interfaces are known to use them.

    Notes:

    * Reserved for the system: this  basically means that the maker should
      consult Japan ASCII for permission to use some port. Of course, most
      hardware makers  today simply  ignores  the simple existance  of any
      standard definer and  goes on filling up  the  not much  left unused
      ports with not very much reliable devices. Anyway, it is a good idea
      to check twice the possibilities of  memory access registers instead
      of I/O ports.


   ** When MSX2 had just been  released, the number of MSX was large, so a
      special cartridge had been released with the MSX2 VDP IC inside, the
      V9938. That cartridge could be simply inserted in an MSX slot and it
      would become an MSX2. The video access ports, of course, couldn't be
      shared by both internal MSX and external MSX2 VDP, so new ports were
      defined  to the  second. The  addresses 0006H and 0007H  of the Main
      BIOS  contain the  read and write port numbers of the VDP. But don't
      matter  how much each and every  documentation, official or not, ask
      users and programmers to use such addresses, they still insist using
      the VDP ports of their own machines directly, without consulting the
      currently running  system  ROM. The inevitable result  is  that most
      programs, lazily coded, still crash around, for example, in MSX with
      expansion cards (believe  me, they still exist, I have  already seen
      one working perfectly). So, if you are a good programmer  and didn't
      knew about such problem, here is a list of VDP access ports:

      + port #0 reading: (0006H)
      + port #0 writing: (0007H)
      + port #1 reading: (0006H)+1
      + port #1 writing: (0007H)+1
      + port #2 writing: (0007H)+2
      + port #3 writing: (0007H)+3

      What each  port does is  a matter for  another documentation and not
      the purpose  of this one. If you cannot  find information  about the
      subject, send me an E-Mail.


  *** And if  you must, for  some reason, use I/O ports  for your project,
      use the Expansion I/O Ports (from  40H to 4FH):

      This circuitry has the following effects:

      * It keeps the device and the MSX Bus disconnected until it receives
        a valid ID code  through port 40H, so a program that wants  to use
        the device must enable it first, writing the proper ID byte to the
        I/O port 40H. The ID byte may range from 128 to 254 for a specific
        type  of  device or  from  1 to 127 to define a  specific hardware
        maker. The  0 and  255  values are reserved  because  most systems
        returns  one of  those two  when an  empty or disconnected port is
        accessed.

      * If an ID byte different from  the expected is received, connection
        between bus and device is instantly broken. Any and all access are
        ignored until another matching ID value is received from port 40H.

      * If port 40H  is read, the  accessing  program will  receive the ID
        byte of the currently active device.


      MSX standard has not defined any  device that uses the expansion I/O
      ports, so no table of devices exist, but each hardware maker has its
      ID byte (most names are written in EUC [Enhanced Unix Code] Japanese
      characters, but don't worry if you cannot view them or simply cannot
