               Summary of the short cuts of the debugger
               -----------------------------------------

  Due to circumstances during the development of Compass, some important 
information about the debugger hasn't been included in the manual. Here 
follows a listing of the keys you can use in the debugger of Compass.         

    A : Get address for disassembler.
    B : Get address of a new breakpoint.
    C : Put calculator on screen.
    D : Go to disk menu.
    E : Execute untill breakpoint reached.
    H : Get PC-reg to cursor.
    J : Get cursor to PC-reg.
    L : Change link-mode.
    M : Get address for minimonitor.
    P : Change slot-selection.
    Q : Quit.
    R : Go to register-menu.
    S : Step.
    T : Trace.
    U : Return from temporary-address.
    V : View breakpoints.
    W : Delete breakpoints.
    Y : Special trace.

     [RETURN]  : Activate last used pull-down menu.
     [FIRE 2]  : Activate last used pull-down menu.    
     [SELECT]  : Switch between debugger and real-time monitor.
      [STOP]   : Switch between debugger and assembler.
    [F1]..[F5] : Activate pull-down menus.
       [UP]    : With [SHIFT] -> Go backward +/- 200 addresses.
                       [CTRL] -> Go backward one address.
                  single used -> Go backward one instruction.
      [DOWN]   : With [SHIFT] -> Go forward +/- 200 addresses.
                       [CTRL] -> Go forward one address.
                  single used -> Go forward one instruction.

    Remarks
    -------
    P : Change slot-selection.
     When using the debugger we recommend that you use this routine
     if you want to change the current slot-selection. This routine
     changes the intercepted sub-slotregisters that are necessary for
     the interception of the OUT (#A8).
     When presented with an option you don't want to change (f.i.
     memory mapper page) just press [RETURN].

    Subslotregisters are shown at the right of the memory lay-out.
    Upleft you see the subslotregister for slot 0, upright for
    slot 1, downleft slot 2 and downright for slot 3.
