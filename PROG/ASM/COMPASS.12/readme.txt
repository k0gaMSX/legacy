How to use PMEXT?
WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW

The utility PMEXT.COM is a MSX-DOS utility. It has the following syntax:

PMEXT [drv1] filename.PMA [drv2]

drv1         = The source drive where the .PMA-file is 
drv2         = The destination drive for the extracted files 
filename.PMA = The name of the .PMA-file


Example: A:>PMEXT H:MEMAN242.PMA A:


NOTE: Set capslock on to avoid errors with PMEXT!!
