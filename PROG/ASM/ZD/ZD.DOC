                            ZD
                MSX commenting Dizassembler
                       version 3.40
============================================================

     ZD is a commenting dizassembler for Z-80, oriented  for
use on MSX computers. The main features of ZD include:

      + any input format: MSX-DOS program, BLOAD program,
	MSX ROM, code fragment, SPR program.
      + automatic search of strings and pointer arrays.
      + good readability due to meaningful comments.
      + "preprocessor" mode to generate symbol tables for
	further use with dialog dizassembler (DASM or
	compatible).
      + ZD understands MSX-specific RST instructions.


     Executing ZD
     ------------
     The MSXDOS command line for ZD is

	ZD [{-,/}options] inputfile[.ext]

     When no extension is given, ZD tries to  load  first  a
file with null extension and if not found, tries to  load  a
MSXDOS .COM file.
     Output file  has  the  same  name  as  input  and  .ASM
extension. If ZD is used in preprocessor mode, .ASM file  is
not generated, but two tables in DASM  format  are  created:
.SYM (symbol table file) and .CTL (control table file).
     The following options may be used in the command string
(NOT case sensitive):

	A - inhibit string analysis
no search for ASCII strings, do not create DB data

	B# - basic ROM format (# base address, default 4000)
source file is  a  ROM  cartridge  (only  normal,  MEGA  not
supported)

	C - convert out-bound addresses into symbols
normally ZD outputs words that are out of program  range  as
hex numbers. if the option is on, ZD makes them Txxxx, Bxxxx
and Wxxxx data labels.

	D - driver (SPR) format
says that input file is MISIX, NIKE DOS or TINY  DOS  driver
in SPR format.

	E - disable russian letters in DBs
by default symbols  that  may  form  a  string  include  all
printable ASCII characters plus russian letters in the range
0C0h .. 0FFh. E option says that ASCII strings  may  contain
only  7-bit  characters.  This  option  is  recommended  for
dizassembling  european  programs,  cause  it  makes  string
analysis more 'paranoic' and thus more correct.

	F - full symbol list


	G - do not create DB and DW
only plain code, no DB and DW data output

	I - convert 0F000h..0FFFFh to negative ints
this option is useful for high level laguage dizassemble
(especially for C)

	L - local labels of Lhhhh style
use Lhhhh (where hhhh is hex address) for local jump labels

	M - enable MISIX calls
enables MISIX calls, RSTs and system call comments 

	R - search ASCII C runtime library
searches for ?LAUT, ?SAUT and some other functions; corrects
inline parameters for ?LAUT and ?SAUT into word data as
required. This option also restricts character string terminator
to a null character '\0' only.

	V - skip pointer vector analysis
do not search for pointer arrays in program

	N#- program length #

	O#- offset in file #

	S#- program start address #

	X - make symbol files for DASM: *.SYM, *.CTL

	Yfile - enable symbol file (file.ZFS) usage
symbol table file format: records of 8 bytes each;
first 2 bytes contain address, other 6 bytes contain
symbol name, zero terminated if length is less than 6
characters.



     DISTRIBUTION
     ------------
     ZD is _PUBLIC_DOMAIN_
     The package consists of two files: ZD.COM and ZD.DOC
     ZD source code is available for developers  on  special
request. The following versions will be  uploaded  to  FUNET
when will be available.
