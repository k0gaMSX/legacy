     - command MEMORY added
     * MODE can also set screen height
     - in batch file %n& is available, which means every parameter from
       parameter n. n defaults to 1, so %& is the same as %1&.
     - the same applies to aliases: parameters are passed with %n. %n& is 
       also possible.
     - IF(F) also uses EQ, LT and GT instead of just ==
     - DIR option /2 added for two column output
     - instead of .BAT files also .BTM files. These are read into memory 
       completely (max. size 16K, min. 16K of free memory must be available).
       Within these .BTM files labels, GOTO, GOSUB, RETURN and END are 
       possible.

       number of combinations depends on the length of the command line.
       Multiple equations are executed FROM THE LAST TILL THE FIRST.
       Parentheses are NOT allowed.
     - command ATTRIB also uses +A en +S (and -A en -S) to make a file
       system file or archived.
     - all commands expecting a compound-filespec, can also have /S to 
       allow system files to be found too
     - DIR also shows system files with an s (as opposed to h and r)
     - example file DIR.BTM added. Format: DIR.BTM [filespec]. Same as DIR
       command, only not so fast. Also shows file attributes.

New in COMMAND2 version 2.41 (release date: 04-12-97)

     - DIR /W shows directories in lower case
     - Mandatory variables are stored in alias-memory, which leaves more 
       space in TPA
     - Internal Variables added:
       _DRIVEMAP - Returns available drives as 8-bit value. Left is drive 
		   H:, right is drive A:
       _SHELL	 - Returns the shell-number of COMMAND2.COM. Original proú 
		   gram is 0, first shell is 1, etc.
     - Internal Variable Functions added:
       @READY	 - Returns 1 if specified drive is ready or a 0 if it is 
		   not ready, or an empty string when an error occurs
     - IF(F) can also compare expression with spaces. If so, a string needs 
       to be included in brackets { and }.
     - CTRL-TAB puts the new file behind the current one on the command 
       line
     - When in insert mode, cursor up and down put previous command lines 
       behind the current one
     - Special alias UNKNOWN_CMD added. It is executed when an *** Unrecogú 
       nized command error occurs. If this alias does not exist, then the 
       error is generated. Make sure that the alias itself does not raise 
       an *** Unrecognized command error, otherwise an unbreakable loop is 
       entered.
     - TAB is circular. After the last filename, the first one is displayed 
       again.
     - Environment item TABORDER added. This determines whether directories 
       or files are found and in which order. Its value can be:
               BOTH - both directories and file are found, in the order that
                      they appear on disk
	       FILE - only files are found
		DIR - only directories are found
	   FILE,DIR - first files are found, then directories
	   DIR,FILE - first directories are found, then files
     - HISTORY /D added to clear the history buffer
     - HISTORY n added to increase or decrease the history buffer size. n 
       must be between 128 and 4096.
     - Booting with HOME pressed, prevents AUTOEXEC.BAT from being executú 
       ed.

New in COMMAND2 version 2.44 (release date: 11-11-2010)

     - Fixed a bug causing TAB completion to go into an infinite loop in a 
       subdirectory with only the . and .. entries. In such a case a BEEP 
       will occur indicating it couldn't find any name to complete.
     - The COMPATCH is implemented natively. This is to display the free 
       size of a FAT16 partition.
     - Added SHIFT command for batch files. This allows to shift arguments 
       1 position to the left, including an option to specify from which 
       argument the shift will take place.
     - New external command: TYPEWW to type text with word-wrap.
     - New external command: MORE   piping command to pause output display
       per screen.
     * Added BOOT command. Sets the boot drive for when leaving MSX-BASIC.
     * Added HERTZ command. Sets VDP refresh frequency.
     - SET PROMPT ON and SET PROMPT OFF are restored to their respective
       defaults. If PROMPT wasn't set, it defaults to %_CWD%>.
     - Restored ERA, ERASE and RENAME commands for compatibility reasons.
     - Added missing COMMAND2.COM version 2.41 features to the help files.
     - Internal Variable _MSXVER now supports all MSX generations.
     - Added @STRING Internal Variable Function. Returns a string of the
       specified length containing the first character of a string.
