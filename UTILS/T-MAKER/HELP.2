+ 1 COMPUTE
 1/1 WHAT NEXT?     <COMPUTE>
 
 
 COMPUTE tells T/Maker to "calculate" values according to the  row and
 column equations placed in a T/Maker work area.
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Every T/Maker SpreadSheet has:
 
 *  An "Example Line" starting a spreadsheet.
 
    ("Model Numbers"on Example Line locate where columns of numbers are
     placed, and dictate what   format & accuracy  those numbers have.)
 
 *  "Column Equations" that are equations  between numbers in a column.
    ( Equations occupy the first  7  columns in the work area. )
 
 *  "Row Equations" that  are  equations  between the numbers in a row.
    ( Equations are placed above each row. )
+ 2 EX
The EXAMPLE LINE:
 
  (1)  Starts with the word  "EXAMPLE" in the first  7  columns .
  (2)  Provides "Column Model Numbers"
 
         *  Locates where columns of numbers are positioned.
         *  Dictate   accuracy &  format  of  numbers  in  each  column.
         *  Are  separated  from  each  other  by  one  or  more spaces.
         *  Are  formed by any string of characters. (13 digit accuracy)
         *  Are "invisible" if started with a comma.  (see Column ",C" )
 
         Note:  Numbers can be entered anywhere  under the Model Number.
                COMPUTE will align these numbers correctly.
 
  (3)  Must be below the top of the screen before a COMPUTE is invoked.
                   ( See  [ AA ] for  more  information. )

+
Math equations are formed using "operators"  &  "terminators".
 
..............................................................................
Operators are just ordinary "math signs", just like those used on a calculator.
 
 
           ( + )   addition          ( * )    multiplication
           ( - )   subtraction       ( / )    division
 
Note:  Every row & column equation must have at least one ( + ) sign in it.
 
...............................................................................
Terminators are "result signs".
 
           ( = )
 
Also, there are   23  "advanced"  result signs that perform more sophisticated
calculations.  (eg., finding a square root of a result.)
 
                 ( See  Help section  [ TERM ]  for  examples. )
+ 2 AA
            This line is defined as the TOP OF THE SCREEN Line.
 
 
 
 
It was the line the cursor was on before Exiting the Editor.
 
 
Everything below the Top of the Screen Line is considered ACTIVE.
 
 
Commands  (e.g, COMPUTE, PRINT, ALIGN )  will work only in the active area.
So,  it's a good idea to Home The Cursor before the command.
+ 2 COL
  COLUMN EQUATIONS  ARE MADE UP OF MATH SYMBOLS.
  ----------------
* The math symbols in a comn equation must line up under one of
  the letters in the word  "Example", forming a "Vertical Strip".
 
* Once a result symbol ( = ) has been used in a Vertical Strip, a
  new column equation can begin under it in the same Strip.
 
* When two or more result symbols are on the same row,  the final
  result will be the sum of each column equation result.

+ 2 ROW
 ROW  EQUATIONS  show the  MATH  RELATIONSHIP  between  numbers in a row.
 --------------
 
 Each entered row of numbers must have an operator (a math sign) somewhere
 in the first  7  columns of that row.   This lets T/Maker  know there are
 numbers on this row.
 
 Each row of numbers has an equation above it,  called a "row equation".
 
 
                                        ROW EQUATIONS:
 .....................................
 Example   aaa     bbb    ccc        |  *  Always begin with a row code in
 ....................................|     column 1 (eg, the jc in "jc1").
 jc1         +       +      =        |
 +           5       5     10        |  *  Always have a "Row Code Number".
 ....................................|     (eg, the  1  in "jc1")
 jc1         +       *      =        |
 +           5       5     25        |  *  Contain  math signs that appear
 ....................................|     above the number it'll work on.
+
 The "JC1" ROW CODE:
 
 .................................
 Example   aaa     bbb    ccc    |
 ................................|         .......
 jc1         +              =    |     The | JC1 |  row code  tells T/Maker to
 +          10             10    |         |.....|
 ................................|    "JUST COMPUTE"  the NEXT row of numbers
 jc1         +       +      =    |
 +          10       5     15    |    (the next row starting with a math sign)
 ................................|
 jc1         +       -      =    |    according to the equation on the JC1 row.
 +          10       5      5    |
 ................................|
 jc1         +       *      =    |
 +          10       5     50    |
 ................................|
 jc1         +       /      =    |
 +          10       5      2    |

+
 ROW CODE NUMBERS
 
 Up to 30 Equations can operate on a single  row of numbers.  T/Maker stores
 an equation according to it's row code number.
 
 At a row of  entered  data,  T/Maker   will  get  the  equation  stored  in
 .............................................   the  first row code  number
 Example   aaa     bbb    ccc    ddd    eee  |   location (jc1) and performs
 ............................................|   that calculation on the row
 jc1         +       +      =                |   of entered data.
 jc2                        +      -      =  |
 +          10       5     15     12      3  |   T/Maker  then  looks at  the
 ............................................|   second row code number (jc2)
 jc1         +       +      =                |   location and  performs  that
 jc1                        +      -      =  |   equation on the row of data.
 +          10       5      0     12    -12  |
 ............................................|   And so on.
 
 Each equation has a unique row code number.  Re-using a number will
 cancel the previously stored equation.    (Note last example above.)
+
 MULTIPLE ROW EQUATIONS        *  SHORT CUT  *
 
 
 Equations that operate on numbers from left to right can be placed
 on the same row code line.
 
 For example, the second JC1 performs the same math on the data row
 as the first series of JC'S  ( jc1, jc2, jc3 ).
 
 .............................................................
 Example   aaa     bbb    ccc    ddd    eee    fff    ggg    |
 ............................................................|
 jc1         +       +      =                                |
 jc2                        +      -      =                  |

 However, the other row code lines (such as AC) are stored  in  T/Maker
 permanently until replaced by any other  row equation  using the  same
 row code number.

not apply to next row.                        are canceled.
 
 
For both  SC  &  CC  row  codes,  a row code number can be specified
to suspend or cancel a particular row code equation.

Remember . . . All row equations can be accomplished with the JC code.
 
         All other row codes are short cuts for the JC code.

 The  ZERO  VALUE  LINE
 
 You can tell T/Maker how a "null value" ( or zero value ) will be
 displayed.
 
 The  Zero Value line follows the Example Line  and:
 
 *  Starts with the letters   ZV   in the first two columns.
 *  "Zero value symbols" are placed on this line under column and
     will be  used to represent any Zero Value in this column.

+ 2 OCALC
 1/1 WHAT NEXT?   <COMPUTE>        *  ORDER  OF  CALCULATION  *
 
 
 
 A COMPUTE sends T/Maker calculating "left to right" - "top to bottom" once.
 
 1) T/Maker finds the firrst row that has a math sign on it in the first 7 cols.
 
 2) T/Maker calculates any applicable  row equations  for this row in the order
    determined by their row code numbers.
 
 3) T/Maker then goes to the next row with a math sign (in first 7 cols)   and
    calculates the column values if the math sign is a terminator. T/Maker now
    goes back to Step 2.
 
    This loop continues until T/Maker can't find any more rows with math signs
    or until it finds a  Blank Example Line  (contains no Model Numbers).
+ 3 RC
 1/1 WHAT NEXT?   <COMPUTE C C C C C ...>       *  RE-CALCULATION  *
 
 
 You can ask T/Maker to make another  COMPUTE pass at a table by following
 COMPUTE with a " C " (the number of " C "s will be the number of passes).
 
 Thus, you can STORE values calculated at the bottom of a column and FETCH
 them for use at the top of another column by  "re-COMPUTING".

CONSTANTS  can be used in a spreadsheet with use of special row code lin.
 
 
The row code and row code number is followed by the math symbol which will
operate on the constant value.

CLEAN  eliminates the first  7  columns of text, as well as all row &
column equation notation. (CLEAN won't affect Print Design commands.)
 
Warning:   If you iissue CLEAN command without SAVE-ing a spreadsheet,
you cannot get your  Vertical or Horizontal Equations  back.   Always
SAVE before CLEANing.

+ 1 COMBINE
1/1 WHAT NEXT?   <COMBINE>
 
 
COMBINE allows you to "combine" a spreadsheet in the work file area  with
a similar spreadsheets on disk on a spreadsheet by spreadsheet basis.
 
 
 
 
1/1 WHAT NEXT?   <TRANSFER>
 
 
TRANSFER  allows you to "transfer" values in a spreadsheet stored on disk
into a spreadsheet in the working area.  (Cell by cell TRANSFER.)
