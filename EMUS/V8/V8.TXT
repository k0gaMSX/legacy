Key Mappings
============
Most of the original CHIP8 games are programmed for a keyboard with the
following layout:
1 2 3 C
4 5 6 D
7 8 9 E
A 0 B F
This is emulated as follows:
1,2,3,4,q,w,e,r,   -  CHIP8 keypad
a,s,d,f,z,x,c,v
and
9,0,-,=,i,o,p,[,
j,k,l,;,n,m,,,.
Joystick           -  (MSX and ADAM only) 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9
Fire buttons       -  (MSX and ADAM only) 5
Keypads            -  (ADAM only) 1,2,3, 4,5,6, 7,8,9, A,0,B

Special Keys:
F1 (MSX,MS-DOS) /  -  Reset virtual machine
CTRL+X (ADAM)
ESC                -  Quit emulator (Also F10 on MS-DOS version)

Command line options
====================
-h              -  Print a help page describing the available options
-ip <value>     -  Select number of opcodes per interrupt [15 or 16]
                   Increase this value to run your games faster, decrease
                   it to run them slower
-up <value>     -  Select number of interrupts per screen update (MSX and
                   ADAM only) [1]
-bg <filename>  -  Select background picture to load (MSX and ADAM only)
                   [v8.bg]
                   The background picture is simply a dump of the VRAM:
                   Pattern table is at location $0000, the colour table
                   is at $1800
-s <mode>       -  Select synchronisation mode [1]
                   0 - Do not synchronise emulation
                   1 - Synchronise emulation to hardware clock
                   Using -sync 0 will speed up the emulation
