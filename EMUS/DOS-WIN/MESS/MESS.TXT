                   ==========================================

This document is generated for MESS 0.37 BETA 2 (May  8 2000)

Please note that many people helped with this project, either directly or by
releasing source code which was used to write the drivers. We are not trying to
appropriate merit which isn't ours. See the acknowledgemnts section for a list
of contributors, however please note that the list is largely incomplete. See
also the CREDITS section in the emulator to see the people who contributed to a
specific driver. Again, that list might be incomplete. We apologize in advance
for any omission.

All trademarks cited in this document are property of their respective owners.
Especially, the MESS team would like to thank Nicola Salmoria and the MAME team
for letting us play with their code and, in fact, incorporating MESS specific
code into MAME.  Without it, MESS would be substantially less than what it is
right now! ;-)

Usage and Distribution Licence:
===============================
- MESS usage and distribution follows that of MAME.  Please read the MAME
  readme.txt file distributed with MESS for further information.

How to Contact The MESS Team
============================
Visit the web page at http://mess.emuverse.com to see a list of contributers
If you have comments, suggestions or bug reports about an existing driver, check
the page contacts section to find who has worked on it, and send comments to that 
person. If you are not sure who to contact, write to Ben (ben@mame.net) - who is the 
current coordinator of the MESS project [DOS]. 

PLEASE DON'T SEND BINARY ATTACHMENTS WITHOUT ASKING FIRST, *ESPECIALLY* ROM IMAGES.
THESE ARE NOT SUPPORT ADDRESSES. Support questions sent to these addresses
*will* be ignored. Please understand that this is a *free* project, mostly
targeted at experienced users. We don't have the resources to provide end user
support. Basically, if you can't get the emulator to work, you are on your own.
First of all, read this doc carefully. If you still can't find an answer to
your question, try checking the beginner's sections that many emulation pages
have, or ask on the appropriate Usenet newsgroups (e.g. comp.emulators.misc)
or on the many emulation message boards.  The official MESS message board is at:
   http://mess.emuverse.com

Also, please DO NOT SEND REQUESTS FOR NEW SYSTEMS TO ADD, unless you have some original
info on the hardware or, even better, have the technical expertise needed to
help us. Please don't send us information widely available on the Internet -
we are perfectly capable of finding it ourselves, thank you.


Complete Emulated System List
=============================
Here is the list of systems supported by MESS 0.37 BETA 2 (May  8 2000)

The meanings of the columns are as follows:
Working - "No" means that the emulation has shortcomings that cause the system
  not to work correctly. This can be anywhere from just showing a black screen
  to not being playable with major problems.
Correct Colors - "Yes" means that colors should be identical to the original,
  "Close" that they are very similar but wrong in places, "No" that they are
  completely wrong. 
Sound - "Partial" means that sound support is either incomplete or not entirely
  accurate. 
Internal Name - This is the unique name that should be specified on the command
  line to run the system. ROMs must be placed in the ROM path, either in a .zip
  file or in a subdirectory of the same name. The former is suggested, because
  the files will be identified by their CRC instead of requiring specific
  names.  NOTE! that as well as required ROM files to emulate the system, you may
  also attach IMAGES of files created for system specific devices (some examples of 
  devices are cartridges, floppydisks, harddisks, etc).  See below for a complete list
  of a systems supported devices and common file formats used for that device

System Information can be obtained from the SysInfo.dat file (online in the MESS UI
from the Machine history) or sysinfo.htm.  To generate sysinfo.htm, execute 
dat2html.exe.

QUICK MESS USAGE GUIDE!
=======================
In order to use MESS, you must at least specify at the command line

      MESS <system>

This will emulate the system requested.  Note that most systems require ROMS for
emulation.  These system ROM files are copyright and ARE NOT supplied with MESS.

To use files created for the system emulated (IMAGES), MESS works by attaching an image
of the file created for the particular device of that system, for example, a cartridge,
floppydisk, harddisk, cassette, image etc.  Therefore, in order to attach an image to the
system, you must specify at the command line:

      MESS <system> <device> <image_name>

To manually manipulate the emulation options, you must specify:

      MESS <system> <device> <image_name> <options>

*For a complete list of systems emulated,  use: MESS -listfull
*For system files (ROMS) required by each system, use: MESS <system> -listroms
*See below for valid device names and usage.
*See the MAME readme.txt and below for a detailed list of options.

Make sure you have ROMS and IMAGES in a subdirectory from your ROMPATH
with the same name as the system (eg ROMS/COLECO)


Examples:

    MESS nes -cart zelda.nes
        will attach zelda.nes to the cartridge device and run MESS in
        the following way:
        <system>      = nes             (Nintendo Entertainment System)
        <device>      = CARTRIDGE
        <image_name>  = zelda.nes       (Zelda cartridge)
        <options>     = none specified, so default options (see mess.cfg)

    MESS coleco -cart dkong -soundcard 0
        will run MESS in the following way:

        <system>      = coleco          (ColecoVision)
        <device>      = CARTRIDGE
        <image_name>  = dkong.rom       (Donkey Kong cartridge)
        <options>     = default options without sound (see mess.cfg)

    MESS trs80 -flop boot.dsk -flop arcade1.dsk
        will run MESS in the following way:
        <system>      = trs80           (TRs-80 model 1)
        <device1>     = FLOPPYDISK
        <image_name1> = boot.dsk        (The Trs80 boot floppy diskl)
        <device2>     = FLOPPYDISK
        <image_name2> = arcade1.dsk     (floppy Disk which contains games)
        <options>     = default options (all listed in mess.cfg)

    MESS cgenie -flop games1
        will run the system Colour Genie with one disk image loaded,
        automatically appending the file extension .dsk.


If you dont want to type out device/image combinations, MESS supports 
ALIASed command lines from MESS.cfg.  An example entry is:

    [ti99_4a]
    parsec = -cart parsecg.bin -cart parsecc.bin 

So to load these images, you would simply then type:

    MESS ti99_4a -alias parsec

and both cartridges will be attached to the TI99_4a.




DEVICE support list
===================
As mentioned, in order to fully utilise MESS, you will need to attach image files
to the system devices.  The following list specifies all the devices and image 
file extensions currently supported by MESS.  Remember to use the DEVICE name 
(or the brief name) to attach an image.  This list can easily be generated by 
specifying:

    MESS -listdevices

Also note that MESS has a preliminary built-in File Manager for attaching images to
system devices.  Use the UI (TAB key) to access.
