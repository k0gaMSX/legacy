      This is a SPECIAL INTRODUCTION.  We  won't try to go  through  all
      of  T/Maker,   just  enough  to  give you a "hands on" feeling how
      T/Maker does things.
 
      Please note,  T/Maker will ONLY operate in the manner suggested by
      each T/Maker Lesson.

|   T/Maker:   The  Electronic  Chalkboard   |
|............................................|
 
 
     Think of T/Maker as an  "electronic chalkboard".   You're  only  in
     one of two places with T/Maker.
 
 
     (1)   You're working on the Chalkboard.  (EDIT MODE)
 
     (2)   OR  you are standing away from the Chalkboard telling T/Maker
           what to do with the work on the board.  (COMMAND MODE)
 
 
     Right now, you are standing away from the Chalkboard, and can tell
     T/Maker what to do via COMMANDS.

     You know you are standing away from the  Chalkboard because  you can
     see the WHAT NEXT? prompt below, waiting for you to enter a Command.
 
 
     Let's  CREATE  a new chalkboard to work on.  We'll name our new work
     area   LETTER .

Report:    ALIGNING TEXT
 
 
T/Maker    takes    a    very    VISUAL   approach   to   aligning   text.
  Notice those angled braces above this report ?
They are called    ALIGNING    WEDGES.
 
Aligning     wedges are        T/Maker's visual approach to aligning text.
The     left wedge shows the           LEFT MARGIN,  and  the
                 right     wedge    shows  the   RIGHT MARGIN.

|    By this time,  you should realize that T/Maker tries to do things in    |
