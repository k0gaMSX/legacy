GHOSTLY MANOR




-Quick Guide-


Trifle is lost inside a creepy mansion crowded with sweet monsters.

There is a key in each and every room that, when taken, will open the exit door.

The use of magic power to create or vanish colour blocks will help Trifle to reach any area in the room.

She can also jump and crack blocks from below.




Beware of the creatures: they happen to live there and don’t want to hurt Trifle.
However, contact should be avoided as every touch will get her scared.
The game will be over if she gets scared too many times.

A few colour blocks may contain hidden money bags to increase score. You can garner extra bravery for Trifle by collecting them as well.
