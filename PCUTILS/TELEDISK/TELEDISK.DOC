     TeleDisk At a Glance

     What TeleDisk Is

     TeleDisk is a utility which will convert any diskette into a file and vice-
     versa.    The diskette need not be a DOS diskette;  certain types of "copy-
     protected" diskettes are also handled.   The result is an exact copy of the
     original diskette.   The file produced by TeleDisk is compressed to minimal
     size and is handled by most telecommunications file transfer protocols, in-
     cluding Kermit and XMODEM.

     We initially had a problem in explaining in ten words or less exactly  what
     it  was that TeleDisk did.   One of our customers hit on the description of
     TeleDisk as a "diskette FAX machine".  A very accurate description!

     We at Sydex develop software and we also carry out support  activities  for
     that software.  Part of any "bug hunting" operation is the task of duplicat-
     ing problems.   And part of duplicating problems is obtaining the necessary
     supporting materials.

     If "supporting materials" means only one or two files,  obtaining  them  is
     easy  -  just  upload  them via a modem and a communications package.   If,
     however,  the supporting material takes the form of many files  in  several
     directories,  or  worse yet,  data on a diskette from an alien system in an
     unknown format,  getting the information over a telephone line can be a big
     problem.   Our only viable response in such a case had been "Can you Fed Ex
     it to us?".  Clearly, something better was warranted.

     And so TeleDisk was born.   This utility allows you to take a diskette  and
     convert  it  into  a  file.    You  can  then transmit this file using your
     favorite communications program and again use TeleDisk  to  reconstruct  an
     exact  copy  of the diskette from that file.   No muss,  no fuss - and very
     easy to use.  Some applications immediately suggest themselves:

          *    "No brainer" file transmission.   Just send  the  whole  diskette
               without worrying about getting all the right files.

          *    Preservation of disk directory entries,  including hidden,  read-
               only and system files, as well as volume labels and directories.

          *    Transmit diskettes complete with boot sectors.

          *    Transfer "foreign" diskette formats - an answer to how to send  a
               diskette from, say, a Wang word processor over the phone lines.

          *    If  diskette  image files are placed on a hard disk,  they can be
               saved on a streamer tape backup unit.

          *    Transfer entire diskettes over a network.

     TeleDisk at a Glance
     ___________________________________________________________________________

     About "copy protected" diskettes...   It is not the intent of Sydex to  en-
     courage   copyright  violation  by  making  it  easier  to  transmit  "copy
     protected" diskettes.  It may be true that TeleDisk will handle a number of
     copy protection schemes,  resulting  in  a  faithful  reproduction  of  the
     original; however, this is a necessary "side effect" of the basic operation
     of  TeleDisk.   Please note that most commercial software agreements do not
     authorize you to redistribute copyrighted material to  third  parties,  and
     that by doing so,  you may be held in violation of U.S.  copyright law,  as
     well as being held liable for civil damages.

     TeleDisk has a number of interesting features:

          *    The ability to copy one or both sides of a diskette.

          *    The ability to copy just the diskette sectors allocated by DOS.

          *    Optional use of an "advanced" data compression  algorithm  (LZSS-
               Huffman) to produce minimal file size.

          *    Automatic "splitting" of files across several diskettes if neces-
               sary.  This is essential for diskette-only systems.

          *    Menu-driven with online help screens.

          *    Support  of  low-density (180K and 360K) formats as well as high-
               density (1.2M and 1.44M) formats.   Single-density diskettes  may
               also be processed, if the hardware permits.


     How To Use It

     TeleDisk  will  run under any version of MS-DOS or PC-DOS from 2.1 on.   It
     will also operate in the DOS Window under OS/2.   We haven't tested it with
     Digital  Research's DR-DOS,  but we have no reason to believe that it won't
     work with it.

     Anything from an original PC to a 80486 system should be adequate.   A cer-
     tain  amount  of PC compatibility is required;  TeleDisk will not work with
     the IBM PC Jr.,  the Tandy 2000,  or the very low-end Tandy  1000  systems,
     such as the 1000 EX or 1000 HX.
     If you have a typical PC XT-compatible system with up to four 360K diskette
     drives or an AT-compatible with up to two diskette drives,  TeleDisk should
     operate "right out of the box".   If you have an XT-compatible with 3.5" or
     a  5.25" high-density drive,  or an extra diskette adapter,  you'll need to
     specify your configuration by running the TDCONFIG program.  If you have an
     AT-compatible with more than two diskette drives,  you'll also need to  use
     the  TDCONFIG program.   If you're using a PS/2 with more than one diskette
     drive, you'll need to run TDCONFIG.  A description of TDCONFIG is presented
     in the next section.

     Otherwise, just execute the command:

                     TELEDISK

                                       Page 2


     Configuring TeleDisk
     ___________________________________________________________________________

     No other files are needed.   TeleDisk normally generates  its  displays  in
     color, hardware permitting.  If, however, a monochrome display is required,
     it may be had by executing:

                    TELEDISK /M

     After  this  point,  it's  only  necessary  to follow the directions on the
     menus;  press the F1 key for online help.   The ESCape key is used to  ter-
     minate the current activity.   If you are using a diskette-only system, you
     should have one or two blank, formatted diskettes to hold output file which
     TeleDisk produces.   It's good practice to write-protect the  source  (ori-
     ginal) diskette when you are making a file from it using TeleDisk.

     All TeleDisk files have an filename extension (type) of TD0 through TD9.


     Configuring TeleDisk--TDCONFIG

     As was mentioned in the preceding section,  TeleDisk normally needs no cus-
     tomization.  However,  users with any of the following equipment configura-
     tions should pre-configure TeleDisk:

          1.   A  PC  XT  or  compatible  with 3.5" drives or 5.25" high-density
               drives.

          2.   Any system with more than one diskette adapter card.

          3.   Any system with external diskette drives.

          4.   Any system using the MicroSolutions CompatiCard.

          5.   Toshiba T3100 owners.

          6.   Any system with a line of the following form  in  the  CONFIG.SYS
               file:
                    DEVICE=DRIVER.SYS...

     To pre-configure TeleDisk,  start the configuration program by entering the
     following DOS command:

                    TDCONFIG

     TDCONFIG prompts for the location of the TELEDISK.EXE file  and  where  the
     configured TeleDisk is to be placed.

     A  few  questions are asked about the computer system hardware;  almost all
     are answered with a simple "Yes" or "No".   If TeleDisk is being configured
     for  a  PC  XT or compatible with high-density diskette drives,  the system
     must be identified as a PC AT instead of a PC XT.    Toshiba  T3100  owners
     without the 1.44Mb high-density option should identify their system as a PC
     XT, rather than as a PC AT.

     A disk drive display will be presented, similar to that shown in Figure 1.

     Configuring TeleDisk
     ___________________________________________________________________________


     TDCONFIG prompts for drive characteristics with short multiple-choice ques-
     tions for each field.  Note that there must be no free entries (marked with
     "(NONE DEFINED)") between drive entries;  that is,  all of the free entries
     must come at the end of the table.

     The drive letter field can be any letter of the alphabet.   In addition,  a
     given physical drive may be reproduced several times in the drive table un-
     der different drive letters.

     The unit field is perhaps the cause of the most confusion.  If only one dis-
     kette adapter is present,  units 0 through 3 generally correspond to drives
     A: through D:, with E: being the first hard disk.   No diskette adapter ad-
     dresses  more than four units;  each additional adapter begins the unit ad-
     dress sequence all over again with unit 0.

     The adapter field is set to PRIMARY if only one diskette adapter is present
     on the system.   A second diskette adapter is designated as SECONDARY;  its
     I/O port base address most commonly is 370.   However,  some secondary dis-
     kette adapters, most notably the CompatiCard,  can deviate from this;  con-
     sult the manufacturer's reference material for information.

     The drive type field simply reflects the maximum capacity of the correspond-
     ing diskette drive.  Thus, a 1.2Mb high-density drive need only appear once
     for both 1.2Mb and 360K operating modes.

     Getting Started
     ___________________________________________________________________________

     All  modern  diskette  drives can operate at a 6 millisecond stepping rate.
     If a drive appears to be excessively noisy,  this time should be  shortened
     to  4  milliseconds.   Very old 8" drives can be accommodated with stepping
     rates up to 28 milliseconds.

     The resulting pre-configured TELEDISK.EXE file can be saved on any disk  or
     directory.

     Getting Started With TeleDisk

     The whole of TeleDisk is contained in the file TELEDISK.EXE; no other files
     are required.  To start TeleDisk, simply enter

                    TELEDISK

     at  the DOS command prompt.   If your computer has a color display adapter,
     TeleDisk will make use of color in its displays.   If you have a monochrome
     display  connected to a CGA or EGA,  you'll probably want to suppress color
     selection by invoking TeleDisk with

                    TELEDISK /M

     TeleDisk normally searches the current (default) directory for data  files.
     A different directory or drive may be specified with the TELEDISK command:

                    TELEDISK C:\MYDIR

     After a brief sign-on display, the menu shown in Figure 2 is displayed.

     The  F1 key always brings up a help display,  whose content is dependent on
     the function being performed (context-sensitivity).   In addition,  the ES-
     Cape  key usually terminates the current operation and return to the previ-
     ous display.

     Error conditions are signaled by an "Alert" which pops up over the  current
     display.    Figure  3 shows the result of a duplicate file situation.   The
     "Alert" box may be moved around the screen through the use  of  the  cursor
     keys.    If  the  F1 key is pressed,  a help screen giving more information
     about the error condition is displayed.

     Selection of the function to be performed by TeleDisk is also  accomplished
     with the cursor keys.

     To make a file from a diskette,  use the cursor keys to position the blink-
     ing area to Copy Disk to File and press the ENTER key.   To recreate a dis-
     kette  from  a  file,  use the cursor keys to position the blinking area to
     Copy File to Disk and press the ENTER key.

     The choice Copy Disk to Disk is the equivalent of a Copy Disk to File  fol-
     lowed  by  a  Copy  File  to Disk using the same file;  no file is actually
     created, however.

     Creating a Diskette Image File

     When the Copy Disk to File operation is selected,  the menu shown in Figure
     4 appears.

     Source Diskette Drive is the drive containing the diskette  to  be  copied.
     This  drive  may also be used for the resulting output file - a prompt will
     be issued when diskettes need to be switched.

     Check Diskette for Data has meaning only if the diskette is not a DOS  dis-
     kette  and  DOS  Allocated under Read Which Sectors has been selected.   If
     Both Sides is selected,  both sides of the diskette are inspected for data.
     If only one side is found to contain data, then only that side is examined.
     If One Side is selected, the second surface of the diskette will not be ex-
     amined.    This  feature  is  useful  when a single-sided diskette has been
     copied to a diskette which has had both sides formatted.

     Read Which Sectors determines how the source diskette data is  interpreted.
     If Both Sides is selected,  no interpretation of the diskette is attempted,
     and all sectors on the diskette are recorded verbatim.    If  DOS  Only  is
     selected,  an  attempt will be made to recognize the diskette as having one
     of the standard DOS formats.   If the diskette does,  in  fact,  contain  a
     recognizable DOS file structure, then only those sectors actually belonging
     to data files will be recorded.   The DOS Only mode of copying is generally
     at  least twice as fast as the non-DOS mode because certain assumptions can
     be made concerning the diskette format.

     Side 0 and Side 1 cause the data from just that side to be  copied  to  the
     image file.

     Creating Diskette Image Files
     ___________________________________________________________________________

     Data  Compression  Method  determines  how  much  effort  should  be  spent
     "squeezing" the diskette file  to  its  smallest  representation.    Normal
     causes  simple  repeated-byte  compression  to  be  used and operates quite
     rapidly.   Advanced compression make use of Lempel-Zev and adaptive Huffman
     techniques in addition to repeated-byte compression.   Advanced compression
     is somewhat slower than normal compression,  particularly on XT-class  com-
     puters,  but typically results in an output file size 40-50 percent smaller
     than that achieved with normal compression only.

     After the appropriate selections have been made,  the ENTER key is  pressed
     and a prompt appears for the name of the file to which the diskette informa-
     tion  will  be  written.   If the file name supplied contains an extension,
     that extension will be ignored.   All TeleDisk files are initially  created
     with an extension of TD0.

     If  an  output  file is created on a diskette and the diskette has insuffi-
     cient room to hold the  entire  initial  TD0  file,  TeleDisk  prompts  for
     another  diskette  and creates a new file with a TD1 name extension.   This
     process  continues from diskette to diskette until the Copy  Disk  to  File
     operation is complete.

     If  such  a multi-volume file is used when a File to Disk operation is per-
     formed,  TeleDisk will prompt for each diskette as it is required.   If all
     volumes were copied to a hard disk,  all files are accessed without prompt-
     ing.

     After the file name has been entered and TeleDisk has succeeded in creating
     the file, the operating display appears and TeleDisk proceeds with the copy
     operation.

     When enough  data  has  been  copied  from  the  source  diskette  to  fill
     TeleDisk's internal buffer,  the window shown in Figure 5 appears.   A com-
     ment up to 8 lines of 72 characters may be entered.  Full editing functions
     using cursor keys,  including insert and overtype modes are available.   In
     addition,  line-drawing semigraphic characters are available as Alt-shifted
     keys on the top row of the keyboard.   More specific information is  avail-
     able through the F1 "help" key facility.

     If no comment text is entered,  the comment record will be omitted from the
     image file produced.  This "comment-less" image file is compatible with ear-
     lier versions of TeleDisk.

     drive is present or pre-configured, this menu is not displayed.   After the
     destination drive is chosen,  a prompt for the name of the source file con-

     Copying From A Diskette To A Diskette

     As mentioned earlier, this option is the logical equivalent of performing a
     Disk  to  File operation,  followed by a File to Disk.  However,  no inter-
     mediate file is created.  The menu for this function appears in Figure 9.

     Source Diskette Drive specifies which drive is to contain the original  for
     the  copy  operation;  Destination  Diskette  Drive  specifies the drive to
     receive the copy.   The same drive may be selected for both;  TeleDisk will
     prompt for the correct diskette when required.

     Check  Diskette for Data and Read Which Sectors are the same as the options
     described in Copy Disk to File earlier.

     The Operating Display

     After the operating function and its parameters have been selected, the dis-
     play shown in Figure 10 appears.

     Notice the "thermometer" at about the middle of the display.  TeleDisk uses
     a "bar" indicator as the operation proceeds to give an  indication  of  the
     progress of the operation.   The numbers on the "thermometer" correspond to
     diskette track numbers.  A 360K diskette contains 40 tracks; 720K, 1.2M and
     1.44M all contain 80 tracks.  Thus,  if the thermometer bar indicates 20 on
     a 1.2M diskette, the operation is about one-quarter complete.

     Prompts for diskette changes, as well as error conditions appear in "Alert"
     boxes as described earlier.

     The  GENERAL  portion  of  the  screen tells what was discovered during the
     course of analyzing the diskette, or from reading the file from which a dis-
     kette is to be produced.  A note is made of the following:

          *    Single- or Double-sided diskette

          *    Diskette density

          *    Data compression method used

          *    Sector address range on each side

     The  ANALYSIS display presents a running narration of operation.   The dis-
     play scrolls as it becomes filled and provides a track and side  "tag"  for
     each item of information displayed.

     Compatibility/Revisions
     ___________________________________________________________________________

     When  the  selected copy operation is complete,  an "Alert" box message ap-
     pears.  Pressing any key at this point will cause TeleDisk to return to the
     opening menu.


     Compatibility With Older Versions

     Files produced by Version 1 TeleDisk can be read by the Version 2  product.
     However,  Version 2 files usually will not be read successfully by the Ver-
     sion 1 product.

     Because of its pre-configuration capability,  Version 2 TeleDisk  can  make
     better informed decisions regarding the compatibility of diskette formats.

     The  Advanced  Compression  algorithm  of  Version  2  is entirely new;  in
     general, it more consistently results in significant file space savings.

     Files with comment records cannot be read by TeleDisk versions earlier than
     2.10.   However,  "comment-less" files may still be produced by later  ver-
     sions of TeleDisk.
