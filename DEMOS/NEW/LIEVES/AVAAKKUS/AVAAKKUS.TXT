This is our contribution to the demo
competition at The Alternative Party
'98 held in Turku, Finland. Coded in
a great hurry once again (took only
five days). Should run on any MSX with
a disk drive and 64k RAM.

Code         : Marq
Music+player : Yzi
Graphics     : Man & Marq

I'd like to thank Nyyrikki for the
BIOS info and welcome our (quite) new
member, Nf to the group.
