***********************************
 "RAPPIO" by Bandwagon 1998
***********************************

Originally contributed at Altenative 
Party '98 demo competition.

Required:
 -MSX1 with 55k RAM and 16K VRAM
 -Microsoft MSX-DOS 1.0 or higher
 -I don't know or care if it works
  with an emulator.

How: 
 A. Type RAPPIO at the command prompt.
or 
 B. Boot with the diskette in drive.

Who:
 -Neckfreak/coding, graphics, extreme
  underuse of PSG's sound capalities  

 -Gspot/source of musical inspiration 
  and ideas.

Expect for:
 - MSX-tuning values, which were kindly
   obtained from Yzi/L!T.

 - Logarithmic volume table for 
   samples, originally obtained by Marq
   from Sturm/Admirables.
 
How 2:
 Almost entirely created with MSX-SVI
 728 (believe me, precalcing those
 remapping tables on Pascal takes 
 ages..), except for some graphics, 
 which were drawn with Deluxepaint on
 PC. Yeah, I'm ashamed, but I don't see
 any options on MSX1 without a mouse..

 - Hard: 
   - Spectravideo 728 MSX
   - Spectravideo 707 floppy drive

 - Soft:
   - GEN80-assembler
   - SKMSX text editor
   - Borland Turbo Pascal
   - Microsoft Disk Basic
   - MSX-DOS 1.0

 You can get the source code, if you 
 really care. I have to see the trouble
 of commenting and clarifying it 
 (why?), but I'm not going to bother if
 no-one wants it..

Why:
 Writing this one was a living hell, 
 literally. It's definitely not easy
 to write software with an over decade
 old homecomputer, most of the tools 
 are mainly clumsy and slow. So why 
 bother? I spent the last two months 
 writing players, routines and effects, 
 literally hating myself and the tools
 I used. And still, as you can see, the
 result is nothing impressive. It's all
 been done before on an 8-bit computer.
 Probably not MSX1, but who cares? C64
 has a lot of better intros and these 
 machines are all just the same. Right? 
   
 But anyway, watch it, disenjoy it and
 write to me what you thought, 
 especially if you're still using MSX
 of any kind.

Thank you:

 -Nyyrikki (nyke@clinet.fi) for 
  patching my GEN80.
 -Marq/L!T (marq@students.tut.fi) for 
  providing me with source and 
  assistance whenever I needed it.
 -Yzi/L!T for releasing his player 
  sources. 
 -Everybody who had good enough taste
  not to vote for this.

(dislaimer: This came fourth with a
 pitiful 17 points. I wrote all
 the text expect for this one before
 I knew the results. That's just to
 show you, that even if I don't hate
 my prods and enjoy watching them
 myself, I acknowledge the fact, that
 other people really don't seem to
 like them..)
