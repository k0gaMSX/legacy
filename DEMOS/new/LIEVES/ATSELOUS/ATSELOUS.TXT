  About
  ----- 

 Assembled at the party place in too
 great a hurry. Weird screenmodes don't
 work with an emulator and there are 
 bound to be problems with real MSX's
 as well. 
 
  Credits 
  -------
  Man / Still graphics
  Marq / Code (viewers, scrolly)
  Neckfreak / Code, music

  Closing music was ripped from ST and
  is probably composed by Mad Max.
  Thanks.
